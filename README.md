## User Experience (UX)

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The four colours used are; Red (HEX DB5461), Purple (HEX 3D2B3D), Blue (HEX 247BA0), and White (HEX FFFCF7).
    -   #### Typography
        -   Archivo and Hind are the main fonts used throughout the whole website, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Archivo and Hind compliment each other nicely. They look attractive, but not overpowering.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It is an image of the avatar I will be using in various applications across the Metaverse. For consistency, variants of the same image are used througout social media. This ensures users quickly know they have arrived at the right place.
